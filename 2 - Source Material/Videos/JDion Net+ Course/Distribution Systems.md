## Notes
#### Cable Distribution Systems
Demarcation Point
- where ISP cable run is terminated and your network starts
MDF (Main Distribution Frame)
- core switch, back bone of network
- connects out to IDFS
IDF (Intermediate Distribution Frame)
- edge switches that connect to end user devices
Racks
- house networking equipment, servers, power equipment
Patch Panels
- used for splitting up copper cable runs,
Fiber Distribution Panels
- used for splitting up fiber cable runs

#### Power Distribution Systems
UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply)
- Device that provides line conditioning, surge/spike protection, and battery backup
- provide power when main line fails
- usually last 15-30 minutes
PDU (Power Distribution Unit)
- distribute electric power to equipment
- power monitoring, surge/spike protection, control features, no battery backup
- used with UPS
Generator
- generate power in total power outage
- take some time to come up to speed
- paired with UPS
- Auto Transfer Switches allow the Generators and UPS to work together
	- lose power > UPS takes load > Generator powers on and starts warming up > Once warmed up, Auto Transfer Switch switches power from UPS to generator > once main power is back up for say, 5 minutes, Auto Transfer Switch switches power from generator to main power source
Power Loads
- need to manage to ensure efficient power usage and prevent circuit overloads
Voltage Considerations
- understanding voltage standards is vital when ordering equipment
- need transformers to convert between voltages
